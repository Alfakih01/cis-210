Project Summary:
The given project is a C++ program that calculates and displays the year-end balance and earned interest for an investment over a specified number of years. The user is prompted to input the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment. The program then calculates and displays the investment's balance and earned interest at the end of each year. It does this for two scenarios: one without additional monthly deposits and another with an additional fixed monthly deposit.

Problem Solved:
The program solves the problem of calculating the growth of an investment over time, factoring in both the initial investment and recurring monthly deposits. It helps users visualize how their investment would accumulate and how the earned interest would contribute to the final amount.

Strengths:

The program is well-structured with a clear main function and a separate function for calculating yearly balances, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
Proper use of comments helps explain the purpose of each section of code.
The program handles user input validation for investment-related values.
Areas for Enhancement:

Implementing input validation for non-numeric inputs (e.g., entering characters instead of numbers).
Adding validation to ensure that the annual interest rate and number of years are within reasonable ranges.
Providing more user-friendly error messages for incorrect inputs.
Adding flexibility by allowing users to choose the frequency of deposits (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually) rather than just monthly deposits.
Challenging Pieces:

Input validation to handle non-numeric inputs and to restrict inputs within appropriate ranges could be challenging to implement. Using loops and conditional statements can help overcome these challenges.
Overcoming input errors and handling user experience issues related to invalid inputs could require additional research on input validation techniques and best practices.
Transferable Skills:

Coding Structure: Organizing code into functions for specific tasks promotes code modularity and reusability, which is valuable in various programming projects.
User Interaction: The handling of user input and output is a fundamental skill applicable to many software applications.
Documentation: Writing clear comments and explanations contributes to maintainable and readable code in any programming project.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:

The code is organized into functions with meaningful names, making it modular and maintainable.
Use of clear variable names, comments, and consistent formatting enhances code readability.
The separation of concerns between the input gathering, calculations, and display functions allows for easy adaptability and potential future improvements.
